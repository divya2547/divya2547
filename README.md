👋 Hi, I’m @divya_Parmar.

🎓 Studied a Diploma in Computer Engineering, Bachelor's in IT Engineering from Mumbai University, and a Master's in Business Analytics and Big Data from the University of Dundee.

👀 I’m passionate about analysing data, uncovering trends, and turning insights into strategies that drive business impact.

💻 Skilled in analytical and technical tools: Excel, Python, SQL, Power BI, PowerPoint, and more.

🌱 I’m currently learning Machine Learning and exploring advanced data analytics techniques.

📈 I enjoy working on real-world data projects and continuously improving data storytelling skills.

🤝 I thrive in collaborative environments and love engaging with cross-functional teams.

⚡ Fun fact: I make sure to learn one data hack a day — and ChatGPT is my best friend on that journey!

☕ Outside of data, I enjoy coffee chats, mentoring peers, and staying up to date with tech trends.
